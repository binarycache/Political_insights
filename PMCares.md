# Topic: PM introduced a separate fund (other than already existing PMNRF) called PMCares for Coronavirus.

# Issues: 
1. Why do you need a separate fund?
2. What is the transparency level?

# Facts:
1. Allows micro-donations and uncapped corporate donations.
2. Same as PMNRF.

# Viewpoints

1. Neutral: Since it has the same transparency as any other such emergency funds and allows the micro-donations and uncapped corporate donations, it is very much in the interest of the unprecedented Corona-virus situation.

2. Ideal: All such funds should be much more transparent with mandatory real time declaration of sources thus eliminating the need of RTI.

3. Pro BJP: No transparency is needed, we believe Modiji and ourselves fully. 

4. Pro Congress: 
    a. We want full and unprecedented levels of transparency before you can use PMCares.
    b. The emergency of Covid is your excuse for corruption, what about education, roads, jobs and economy?
